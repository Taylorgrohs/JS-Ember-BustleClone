    "body1": "I've been going to at least one fashion week show, big or small, every year since 2008. As a lover of fashion and beauty, I would imagine it produces a similar level of excitement to seeing a few of your fav artists at Coachella or Comic Con. Not a Front Row Totem or Velvet Rope Party Creature, I’m on the beauty beat for NYFW, watching backstage as the top artists and their teams crank out hair, makeup, and nails for model after model. So getting dressed for street style photos has never been a top priority for me.",
    "body2": "Sure, my wardrobe is fun, but I go through extreme phases, and often can't see outside of those phases until weather or inspiration forces me to switch it up. Plus, the Autumn/Winter shows in February have a decidedly more somber feel than the Spring/Summer presentations in September: The weather sucks, and all involved would probably rather be kicking it by a fire with a hot toddy. But come rain, snow, or sleet, this is too important to miss. Which means I actually have to get dressed and go outside every day during NYFW, no matter how terrible the weather."
