Remember the parent-chaperoned parties of yesteryear, when the most risqu√© event was a soul-bearing round of Never Have I Ever? Those moments encouraged character-revealing conversations and strengthened bonds, all between bursts of soda-through-the-nose laughter. The best games to play at parties or on a night in can create that same feeling, but hopefully, they're now more enlightening than passing around a check yes or no note in homeroom.
Selecting the best game for you and your crew is pretty much an art form.
